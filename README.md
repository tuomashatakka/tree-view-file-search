# tree-view-file-search Atom.io package

Super fast & *handy* complementary package that adds an additional inset panel to the
bottom of the tree-view's panel. A simple set of controls for filtering files with their
extensions & searching by filename in real time are provided.

Very useful for large projects - no need to `ctrl(/cmd) + t` constantly anymore!

## Instructions

Activate by running the ```tree-view-file-search:toggle``` command
